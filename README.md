# About

The main idea behind this portfolio was to simulate a Windows terminal. By interacting with it, the user can access its functionalities.

# Background

The library __p5.js__ was used to create an interactive background that generates a different and random pattern for its circles every time the page is reloaded or when the user moves the mouse.
